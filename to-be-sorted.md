## reverse receptor uncoupling

a disturbance in homeostasis results in an epileptiform auditory phenomenon. Specifically a diminution of inhibition, mediated by a GABA disconnection from excitatory glutamate inputs.

Stimulate NT-3

Idebenone
Stimulates NGF, antioxidant properties have been disputed. (http://www.ncbi.nlm..../pubmed/9062669)

Pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ)
An antioxidant that also stimulates NGF. Found to be a potent enhancer for the regeneration of peripheral nerves. (http://www.ncbi.nlm....pubmed/15915445)

Selegiline
A metabolite of Selegiline, desmethylselegiline, elevates NGF, BDNF, and GDNF. (http://www.ncbi.nlm....pubmed/11162424)

# lower cholinergic activity

After cochlear damage induced by noise trauma cholinergic activity in the ventral (VCN) and dorsal (DCN) cochlear nucleus is upregulated for up to 2 months (the longest duration studied), suggesting a role for this pathway in adaptations that occur in hearing loss (Jin et al., 2006, Kaltenbach and Zhang, 2007 and Meidinger et al., 2006).


NSI-189 has been shown to increase the hippocampal volume of adult mice by 20%,[3][verification needed][medical citation needed] and has been shown to stimulate neurogenesis of human hippocampal stem cells in vitro and in vivo.

Riluzole

Meclofenoxate

small peptide called FGL boosts learning and memory when administered to rodents, and is poised to begin clinical trials in Alzheimer’s disease patients this year.

pramipexole


neprilysin

Leu-Ile

Quercetin and Kaempferol stimulate BDNF and reduce amyloid-beta toxicity.

gotu kola

OTOH neupogen is a CD34+ mobilizer; it forces them to leave the bone marrow and enter the circulation.

I took aniracetam, oxiracetam, sulbutiamine together yesterday and suddenly I heard... SILENCE!

Ladostigil

melatonin

Cyclobenzaprine

Hydergine

D-cycloserine

Dimethyl Sulfoxide

I've actually recently (several episodes over last week) experienced strongly improved hearing from combining fo-ti (1g x 2 times daily) with piracetam intake (about 2.4g x 2 times daily). The effect seems delayed from the intake of the fo-ti (organic powder) with about 24 hrs or a bit more. The effect is strong enough to slightly unsettle me (I've had about 30% less hearing on one ear for more than 15 years so sudden increase in hearing is quite incredible..).


The price includes: Delivery with UPS or TNT Express, certificate of analysis, MS certificate and HPLC certificate.

noopept, oxiracetam, piracetam, alpha-GPC, and ALCAR

CDP Choline + Piracetam

sulbutiamine

've noticed that dopaminergic drugs ( e.g. Selegiline, Piribedil, Bupropion etc. ) and supplements ( e.g. L-tyrosine, L-phenylalanine, also uridine etc. ) substantially alleviate my tinnitus.

s pegfilgrastim, which is long-acting and might be effectively cheaper.



Granix and Zarzio, in particular, are generics which are theoretically available in the US and might be cheaper than Neupogen.


semax

L-Lysine, Zinc Picolinate and Lithium Orotate
 think the best solution for a tinnitus sufferer is to be relieved of your anxiety towards it. Lysine and zinc (picolinate or opti zinc) works wonders for me,

neurontin

Picamilon


I have received an email by the great Dirk De Ridder this morning about sLoreta (24 electrodes) and Loreta qEEG (64 electrodes) in general. This exam are most important because there is a possibility to target with apposite drugs the centers of hiperactivity. I was ask to him for an opinion about Jeanmonod surgery (HIFU) and he gave me another medical advice:

"
You can try Seligiline 5 mg in the morning, and if it benefits you but not enough increase it to 10 mg, and add 3 mg of melatonine in the evening. Selegiline is a drug that works for Parkinson’s disease and seems to be beneficial in some tinnitus patients. Dr Jeanmonod’s treatment works on this common mechanism, and thus if you respond to seligilin chances might be higher you will respond to his treatment. Please be aware that you should stop the this medication before his LORETA EEG as this could influence what he is looking for (thalamocortical dysrhythmia). The melatonine is to improve brain plasticity which occurs predominantly at night.

If that doesn’t work try pentoxyphylline 400 mg, three times a day. This medication has been shown to sometimes improve tinnitus as a side effect.

Kind regards

Dirk De Ridder"


cerebrolysin


 Memantine or another possible NMDA antagonist: Magnesium Threonate (There are several threads about this supplement already).
